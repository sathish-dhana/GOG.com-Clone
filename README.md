We were a team of 2 from the Masai Web-15 batch who worked on cloning the gog.com website as part of our Unit-3 construct week. As a team, we were given a project to clone the gog.com. Our project demonstrates a basic flow of an gaming websitee, where a customer can Sign-up, Login, view and filter products, add their games to a cart and place his or her happy order.
